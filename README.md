# FPGA-Designer

This program takes an input of equations and maps it to an FPGA. More here later

## Todo:
* ask about inputs
* minimizer
* factorer
* specify input format
* interconnect by number of literals
* data structure
* clean up logic_synthesis file

## Files
* FPGAinitializer.py : This program takes user input and creates the FPGA structure.
* logic_synthesis: This comes from assignment 1. It takes a list of equations and parses it so that each equation is in POS format and can be minimized. It also allows for factoring the equations related to each other.
